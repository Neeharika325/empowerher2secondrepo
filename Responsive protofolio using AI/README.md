                                      I have done my project "Replit AI"

# Responsive Personal Portfolio (HTML + CSS Version)

A modern, fully responsive personal portfolio website built with semantic HTML5 and vanilla CSS3, enhanced with Tailwind CSS for utility styling.

## 📂 Project Structure

This project consists of two main files:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure, content, and Tailwind CSS configuration.
- `styles.css`: Contains custom styles, animations, and theme-specific overrides (Glassmorphism, Aurora Gradients).

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Download the Files**: Save `index.html` and `styles.css` in the same folder on your computer.
2.  **Add Images**: Place your background image (named `aurora-bg.png`) in the same folder.
3.  **Open in Browser**: Double-click `index.html` to view your portfolio. No server or installation required!

## 🎨 Features

-   **Aurora Glassmorphism Theme**: Deep dark background with flowing neon gradients and frosted glass cards.
-   **Fully Responsive**:
    -   **Desktop**: Full navigation bar, 3-column grid layout.
    -   **Tablet**: Optimized padding, 2-column grid layout.
    -   **Mobile**: Collapsible hamburger menu, stacked 1-column layout.
-   **Smooth Animations**: CSS-based fade-in entry animations and hover effects.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid, modern styling without complex build steps.

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### Changing Colors
The theme uses HSL color values defined in the `<script>` tag inside `index.html`.
To change the primary purple color, look for:
```javascript
primary: 'hsl(263.4 70% 50.4%)', // Change these numbers
