# Responsive Personal Portfolio

A professional, responsive portfolio website featuring a "Dark Aurora" glassmorphism theme.

## 🛠 Platform & Tools Used

### **Platform: Replit**
This project was built entirely within the **Replit** cloud development environment, leveraging its instant hosting and integrated AI capabilities.

### **Primary Tool: Replit Agent**
- **Model**: Powered by Gemini 3.0 Pro.
- **Role**: Acts as an autonomous Design Engineer.
- **Contribution**:
  - Generated the initial HTML/CSS structure.
  - Created the "Dark Aurora" visual theme and color palette.
  - Implemented the responsive logic (Desktop vs. Mobile layouts).
  - Wrote the complex CSS animations for the hero and scroll effects.
  - Generated the custom background asset (`aurora-bg.png`) using the built-in image generation tool.

### **Technologies**
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling loaded via CDN for zero-config setup.
- **Google Fonts**: `Outfit` (Headings) and `Inter` (Body text) for modern typography.
- **Lucide Icons**: Lightweight, consistent SVG icons.

## ✍️ Manual Refinements & Edits
While AI generated the core structure, the following parts were manually refined for quality:
1.  **Color Calibration**: Adjusted the HSL values in the `primary` color to ensure accessible contrast ratios on the dark background.
2.  **Mobile Menu Logic**: Fine-tuned the JavaScript toggle behavior to ensure smooth opening/closing animations.
3.  **Grid Responsiveness**: Manually adjusted the CSS Grid breakpoints to switch from 1-column (mobile) to 2-column (tablet) and 3-column (desktop) for better spacing.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Download `index.html`, `styles.css` and `aurora-bg.png`.
2.  Place them in the same folder.
3.  Open `index.html` in any web browser.
